		<div class="aboutpara">We are all about the mission to revolutionize the beauty industry to be equal and diverse. We work hard towards empowering female initiatives within a multitude of communities.<br><br>
		
		"Not Sorry Cosmetics," is an idea of empowering the female through cosmetics and having a chance to evolve and revolutionize today's beauty. With acknowledging the fight on cruel cosmetic animal testing, and to diversify the western beauty standard which would open it's doors to every type of women, no matter what their background and ethnicity. Making a product for the individual rather than the imposed societal idea of a woman. The company's mission is to ultimately rebel against the normal process and status quo of cosmetics and to take control of it and help drive change. Changing the limit of skin tones available in a cosmetic foundation, having lipsticks not derive its ingredients from an animal, and sending a message to young girls to know that they have the power to make a great difference in an approximately $265 billion dollar industry.
